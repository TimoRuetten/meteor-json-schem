# Meteor Json Schema
Simple wrapper for ```jsonschema``` for Meteor with some extras to work better with it.

This package is currently in development so most features are missing.

Please visit [npm jsonschema site](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonschema) for more information about jsonschema.

After you have installed the package you are able to access the ```JsonSchema``` object on **server** and **client**.


**Documentation will be added soon**
